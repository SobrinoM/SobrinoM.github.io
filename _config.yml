intro: |
  I am a physicist with 6 years experience working in technology. I have primarily worked on data analysis and information management. 
  I have primarily worked with R, but have experience in a broad range of technologies: matlab, python, mathematica, and have done some development in C++. 
  

#An additional info freetext section is optional at the bottom of the page - can be text or HTML
additionalinfo: |
   <strong>Python</strong>: My current role uses Python as the primary language and I have been working with Python for the last five years. I am familiar with a the most common Python libraries for data wrangling and analysis.
   <strong>R & Matlab </strong>: R & Matlab have been the primar languages for solving problems in physics numerically.      
   <strong>PowerBI</strong>
   I have also gained experience and knowledge of other technologies from several side projects and research that I have undertaken in my free time, including programming microcontrollers, projects that include the use of public APIs, and cloud platforms such as Azure/AWS. <br/><br/>
